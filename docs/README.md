# Welcome
Welcome to the Balsa Addons SDK documentation site. Here you can find information to get you started making addons for Balsa Model Flight Simulator.

Keep in mind that just as the game, these pages are also a work in progress.

## Setting Up
If you're just getting started, check out the [Getting Started](docs/wiki/gettingstarted.md) guide.


## Balsa Modding 101

Balsa was designed to support modding from the start. You can create new content for the game to add new Parts and Maps (using the Addons Unity project and Balsa Addon Tools), or expand the game itself with new features, by creating C# plugins.

## Steam Workshop Integration

Balsa addons can be published online using the Steam Workshop. The SDK provides a tool to help you publish your addon to the Workshop. See the [Balsaworks Uploader](docs/wiki/balsaworks/uploader.md) page for more information on how to use it.
