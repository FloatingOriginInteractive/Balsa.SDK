# Cheat commands in Balsa

There are a number of cheat commands that can be used, which can be helpful while developing... or if you just want to break free from those petty constraints of reality.


## Usage

To enter cheats, simply type commands directly into the Chat input box (default `Return` key).

Mind that Cheats are not available during multiplayer sessions.

All cheat commands are preceded by a forward slash '/' character.

Most cheats can also be turned off, by following the command with the word 'off' (eg, `/warhead off` disables unlimited ammo)
