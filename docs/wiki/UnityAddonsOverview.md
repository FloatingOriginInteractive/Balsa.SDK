# Unity Addons Project Overview
The BalsaAddons_Unity project is the easiest way to get started making addon mods for Balsa.

It is a pre-configured Unity project, and it includes the Balsa Addon Tools, a set of Unity editor tools to help you generate and export addons into the game.

## Opening the Project

To start the UnityAddons project, open Unity, and on the start page, select the UnityAddons project:

If you don't see the project on the list, add it by clicking the **Open** button on the top, and navigate to the project folder in `Balsa.SDK/BalsaAddons_Unity`.

Unity will present you with a nice progress bar as it imports assets and scripts for some time, after which it will open the project.


## BalsaAddons_Unity Project Workspace

A freshly-opened addons project will likely look like this:

In the project assets, you'll find the included example assets and a sample setup scene with some example addons ready to be exported. Use these for reference when setting up your own.


If you got to this point, you are now done setting up your Unity SDK Project, and you are ready to begin creating your own Addons. Congrats!

Check out the rest of this wiki to learn more about making different types of Addons using the BalsaAddons_Unity tools, such as Parts or Sceneries.
